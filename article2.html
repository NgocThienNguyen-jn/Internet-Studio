                For a long time, reflecting on the past felt like reopening things I had already decided were embarrassing or painful. Every time I looked back, my brain went straight to what I messed up, what I should have done differently, or how I could have been better.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thought reflection meant picking everything apart until I found the mistake.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately, I’ve been trying to change how I do that. Instead of judging my past self, I’ve been trying to understand them. Not excuse everything, but at least be fair.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started noticing how much I’ve actually changed. Things that used to completely stress me out now barely register. Situations that once felt huge now feel manageable. And when I think about who I was back then, I can see that I was just reacting to what I knew at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reflection usually sneaks up on me in quiet moments. Late at night when everything slows down. On walks where I forget my headphones. When a random memory pops up and I let it sit instead of immediately pushing it away.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some of those memories still make me cringe. Others make me sad. But some of them feel surprisingly neutral now. Like they belong to someone I understand better.
            </p>

            <p>
                I realized that being kinder to my past self makes it easier to move forward. When I stop treating old versions of me like they failed, I can see patterns instead. Why I stayed in certain situations. Why I avoided others. Why some things mattered so deeply at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reflection isn’t about getting stuck in the past. It’s about noticing growth, distance, and change. It’s about realizing that I’m not who I was, even if that version of me still exists in memory.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back doesn’t mean going backward. Sometimes it’s just a quiet reminder that I survived things I once thought would break me. And honestly, that feels worth acknowledging.
            </p>

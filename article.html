                I remember my hands shaking as I typed the resignation email. Six years at the same desk, 
                the same routine, the same fluorescent lights humming overhead. My fingers hovered over the 
                keyboard for what felt like an eternity before I finally clicked "send."
            </p>

            <p>
                It wasn't a sudden decision. The discontent had been building slowly, like water behind a dam. 
                There were the Sunday evenings filled with dread, the morning alarms that felt like personal 
                attacks, the meetings that could have been emails, the emails that never should have existed 
                at all. But more than that, there was a quiet voice inside me that kept asking: "Is this it? 
                Is this what I want my life to look like?"
            </p>

            <div class="article-image" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f9d77e, #e89f8d);"></div>

            <p>
                The moment I made the decision to leave, everything shifted. Not externally—the office looked 
                the same, my coworkers were still the same people—but internally, I felt lighter. Like I'd 
                been holding my breath for years and could finally exhale.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, there was fear. Real, tangible fear about money, about health insurance, about what 
                people would think. My parents were confused. "You have a good job," they said, which to them 
                meant stability, a paycheck, benefits. They weren't wrong. But "good job" had started to feel 
                like "safe cage," and I needed to know what it felt like to fly, even if I might fall.
            </p>

            <p>
                The two weeks between submitting my resignation and my last day were surreal. I moved through 
                the motions like a ghost—finishing projects, documenting processes, training my replacement. 
                Some colleagues congratulated me. Others looked at me like I was making a terrible mistake. 
                Maybe I was. Maybe I wasn't. I wouldn't know unless I tried.
            </p>

            <p>
                On my last day, I cleaned out my desk. Six years fit into one cardboard box: a coffee mug, 
                some photos, a plant that had somehow survived my neglect. I looked around the empty office 
                one more time, and instead of nostalgia, I felt relief.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not going to pretend the transition was easy. There were months of uncertainty, of 
                freelancing and odd jobs, of wondering if I'd made a catastrophic error. But there were 
                also mornings when I woke up without an alarm. Afternoons spent pursuing projects I actually 
                cared about. Evenings where I wasn't exhausted from pretending to be engaged in work that 
                didn't matter to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                Would I recommend everyone quit their job? Of course not. But I would recommend everyone ask 
                themselves the question I finally asked: "Am I living, or am I just existing?" Because once 
                you're honest about the answer, you can't un-know it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back now, that email—the one I wrote with shaking hands—wasn't an ending. It was 
                permission. Permission to prioritize myself, to take risks, to define success on my own terms. 
                It was scary, yes. But it was also the most liberating thing I've ever done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes courage doesn't look like fearlessness. Sometimes it looks like clicking "send" 
                despite the trembling in your hands.
            </p>

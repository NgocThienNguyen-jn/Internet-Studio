            <h1>About Soul Chapter</h1>
            <p>
                Soul Chapter is a space for real people to share real experiences. In a world where so much online content feels filtered, performative, or rushed, this platform was created to slow things down. Shared Stories exists so people can tell their stories honestly without pressure, without judgment, and without needing to turn their lives into content.
            </p>    

            <p>
                Everyone carries moments that shaped them. Some are joyful, some are painful, and some are hard to explain at all. We believe those stories matter, and that sharing them can help people feel a little less alone.This isn’t social media. There are no likes, no follower counts, and no pressure to perform. Just stories, shared for the sake of being heard.

            <h2>Design Philosophy: Creating a Safe Emotional Space</h2>
            <p>
                Every part of Soul Chapter is designed to feel calm and approachable.
                The layout is simple and uncluttered so stories are easy to read. The colors are warm and soft to avoid feeling clinical or overwhelming. Typography is chosen for comfort and clarity, not flashiness.
            </p>

            <p>
                    Stories are presented without engagement metrics like likes or view counts. Readers can focus on the words, not numbers.
                    Mood indicators help readers understand the emotional tone of a story before diving in, so they can choose what feels right for them in the moment.
            </p>

                <h3>🎭 Why This Project Exists</h3>
                <p>
                    Shared Stories was created as a semester project exploring how design can support emotional connection and ethical storytelling online.
                </p>
                
                <p>   
                    The goal of this project is to show that websites don’t have to be loud, competitive, or attention-driven to be meaningful. With thoughtful design and care, digital spaces can feel human, gentle, and safe.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This project focuses on human-centered design, emotional awareness, and the responsibility that comes with creating platforms where vulnerability is shared.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>How We Designed This Space</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Soul chapter is designed to feel calm, simple, and safe to spend time in. Every design choice was made with real people in mind; not trends, not metrics, and not perfection.</li>
                <li>We use warm, soft colors like cream, peach, and sage green to create a sense of comfort instead of something cold or corporate. The typography is easy to read and intentional: the headings feel personal and inviting, while the body text stays clean and clear so stories are never hard to follow.</li>
                <li>There’s plenty of space around the text because stories need room to breathe and so do readers. Nothing is crowded or overwhelming. Interactions are kept gentle, with smooth transitions and subtle movement that never distracts from the words.</li>
                <li>Before reading a story, you’ll see a mood indicator to help you understand the emotional tone. That way, you can decide if it’s something you’re ready to read at that moment.</li>
                <li>You won’t find likes, view counts, or engagement numbers here. Stories aren’t meant to compete. They exist simply to be shared and read.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Being Honest About the Risks</h2>
            <p>
                We know that creating a space for personal storytelling comes with real responsibility. Here’s how we think about it:
            </p>

            <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
            <p>
                Sharing personal experiences online can feel risky. That’s why anonymity is always an option, stories can be removed at any time, and we don’t ask for personal details beyond a private email for contact.
            </p>

            <h3>Emotional Safety</h3>
            <p>
                Some stories can be heavy. Mood indicators and gentle language are used throughout the site, and we always encourage people to take care of themselves first. Shared Stories is not a replacement for professional mental health support.
            </p>

            <h3>Content Moderation</h3>
            <p>
                Every story is reviewed before it’s published. We follow clear guidelines focused on respect, honesty, and safety, and we don’t publish content that goes against those values.            
            </p>

            <h3>User Hesitation</h3>
            <p>
                It’s normal to feel nervous about being vulnerable. The platform is designed to lower that barrier from anonymous options to soft language and a journal like layout that feels private, even when stories are shared.
            </p>

            <h3>Spam & Bad Faith Submissions</h3>
            <p>
                All submissions are reviewed by a real person. We care more about meaningful stories than posting as many as possible.
            </p>
        </section>

        
        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>The Impact We Hope to Create</h2>
            <p>
                We hope Shared Stories becomes a place where people feel a little less alone.
            </p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>A place where being vulnerable feels okay.</li>
                <li>Where different perspectives are respected.</li>
                <li>Where stories aren’t compared or ranked.</li>
                <li>Where readers gain empathy and understanding.</li>
                <li>And where sharing your story can feel healing, not scary.</li>
                <li>The act of storytelling itself becomes healing for those who share</li>

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                Soul Chapter began as a project exploring how design can support real human connection online.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea was simple. How can things like color, spacing, typography, and interaction make a website feel safe and comfortable instead of overwhelming. Rather than chasing attention or engagement, this project focuses on empathy, emotional awareness, and being responsible with how stories are shared.

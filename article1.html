                Nothing special happened that morning. That’s kind of the point.
            </p>

            <p>
                I woke up before my alarm and didn’t feel stressed about it. No rush. No immediate feeling that I was already behind on something. The room was quiet, and sunlight was coming through the window in that soft way that makes everything feel calmer than usual.            
            </p>
          
            <p>
                I got up and made coffee, then actually sat down to drink it instead of carrying it around while doing other things. The mug was warm in my hands. The room felt still. I didn’t grab my phone right away, which almost never happens, but it felt good to just exist for a moment without scrolling.            
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Outside, I could hear normal everyday sounds. Cars passing by. Birds. Someone talking in the distance. Nothing exciting, but it made me feel grounded, like I was really present instead of stuck in my head.            
            </p>
           
            <p>
                I noticed how rare that feeling had become. Most days, I’m thinking ahead or replaying things that already happened. That morning, I wasn’t doing either. I wasn’t worried about what needed fixing or what I should be doing next. I just felt okay.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At some point, I realized I was enjoying myself. Not in a big way. Not the kind of joy you post about. Just a quiet, comfortable feeling that didn’t need a reason.
            </p>
                The day eventually moved on. Messages came in. Responsibilities showed up. Life went back to normal. But that small moment stayed with me. It reminded me that joy doesn’t always come from big wins or major changes
            <p>
               Sometimes it’s just a calm morning, a cup of coffee, and a few minutes where everything feels simple. And honestly, that’s enough.

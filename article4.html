            <p>
                I don’t really think about gratitude in a big or dramatic way. It’s not something I sit down and plan to feel. Most of the time, it shows up in small moments that I usually rush past without noticing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like waking up and realizing I actually slept okay. Or finding something clean to wear without digging through a pile of laundry. Or getting a reply to a message that I was lowkey anxious about sending. None of these things feel important on their own, but together, they make the day easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started noticing this on a pretty average day. Nothing exciting happened. I wasn’t especially happy or upset. I was just going through my routine, doing chores, answering messages, trying to get things done. Somewhere in the middle of that, I realized how many things were quietly working out without me paying attention.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thought about the people in my life who show up in simple, consistent ways. The friend who checks in just to see how I’m doing. The family member who remembers small details about me. The coworker who makes things less stressful instead of more complicated. I don’t always say thank you out loud, but I definitely feel it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gratitude, for me, isn’t about pretending everything is perfect or forcing myself to be positive. There are still things that stress me out. Things I want to change. Things I’m unsure about. That hasn’t gone away. But noticing what’s steady and supportive helps keep everything in perspective.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It reminds me that even on days that feel boring or slightly off, I’m still surrounded by small forms of care. Some from other people. Some from routines I’ve built. Some from moments I didn’t even realize I needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes gratitude is just realizing that right now, things are okay. Not amazing. Not terrible. Just okay in a way that feels stable.
            </p>

            <p>
                And honestly, that’s something I don’t want to take for granted.
